## 🚀 What is EduSense?

**EduSense** combines the power of **Machine Learning** and **Generative AI** to help learners understand **how they learn best** — Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, or Reading-Writing.

✅ The app uses a **trained and tested ML model** to classify the user’s learning style  
🤖 Then it calls **LLaMA-3 (via Hugging Face)** to generate personalized study tips and online resources

## 🤖 ML Model Overview

The learning style prediction is powered by a trained **Logistic Regression model** (or optionally **LSTM/BERT**), which has been:

- ✅ Preprocessed using NLTK and TF-IDF vectorization
- ✅ Trained on a balanced dataset of 15,000+ labeled sentences
- ✅ Tested with high accuracy on a validation set


## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Learning Style Predictor** trained on 3k+ labeled descriptions( custom created for the task)
- 🧠 **AI Recommendations** powered by LLaMA-3 (via Hugging Face Inference API)
- ✅ Tested on a separate test set to ensure accurate classification
- 🛠️ Built with **Flask**, **scikit-learn**, and **joblib**
- 🎨 Responsive, clean frontend with HTML/CSS
- 🔐 Secret token protection using `.env`
